# This flag will save you from a lot of gray hairs.

# By default, this is True, but all this does is obfuscate routing errors.
# For example, if you defined a trailing slash here in the backend, then send 
# a request from the frontend without a trailing slash, this flag will cause 
# an automatic redirect to the "correct" route. 

# HOWEVER, the redirect will NOT retain any custom headers you set, eg. auth tokens,
# special dependencies. You will look all over the frontend codebase searching 
# for reasons why headers are not being sent properly, when it was really just
# this flag.

# With this flag False, you will see a very clear 404 and know exactly that you 
# have messed up the route. With it True, you don't know whether the route is
# wrong or something else is wrong.

# So please. Keep this flag.
